# Machine-Learning-Projects

Project Description:
This project is part of the FIT5201 Machine Learning course and focuses on various aspects of machine learning, including model complexity, model selection, probabilistic machine learning, linear regression, classification, and generative vs. discriminative models. The project is divided into multiple sections, each addressing specific machine learning concepts and challenges.

Project Objectives:

Evaluate the impact of model complexity and perform model selection.
Implement K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression and cross-validation techniques.
Explore prediction uncertainty using bootstrapping for KNN regression.
Solve a probabilistic machine learning problem using Bayes' Rule.
Develop Ridge Regression with L2 regularization and analyze its effect on error rates.
Implement a multiclass perceptron algorithm and study its convergence.
Compare the performance of discriminative and generative models as training data size varies.

This project aims to assess students' understanding of various machine learning concepts and techniques. It will help students gain practical experience in implementing and analyzing machine learning algorithms, model selection, and handling real-world datasets.
